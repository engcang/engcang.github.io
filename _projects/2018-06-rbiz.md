ã€€ROS based autonomous driving system for mobile robot (Turtlebot3) is developed for finishing the racing track with diverse missions. Using MATLAB, Lyapunov functional is proved to stabilize the error model of mobile robot. Simple HOG based Cascade Object Detector is trained using Computer Vision Toolbox of MatLab and then all systems are coded with Python to control the robot in real-time. Only 35 dollar Raspberry Pi computer was adopted and it was equipped with 1-D LiDAR and mono camera. Our team won the **<span style="color:#a0ffa0">Mathworks Korea Special Prize.</span>**
