ã€€In this project, we developed indoor SLAM, navigation, and exploration method to operate an UAV exploring the underground power line tunnel safely. In consideration with the limited payload and computational resource of the UAV, the precomputed and lightweight local exploration planner was proposed. Additionally, to charge the battery of the UAV on the UGV with the docking station, relative pose estimation EKF and autonomous landing algorithm was developed.
