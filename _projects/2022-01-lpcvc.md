ã€€Low Power Computer Vision Challenges aims to develop light and fast computer vision solutions to be used in many fields including Robotics. In 2022, the goals of the competition was to track the non-uniform motion vehicle at constant distance away with a quadrotor UAV, while avoiding obstacles. We estimated the trajectory of the moving vehicle in the form of 5th order polynomial using the detected center point with YOLO network. Then, Adaptive weight Model Predictive Controller (AMPC) is designed to track the target effectively.
