ã€€KHNP Virtual Robot Challenge aims to develop a autonomous navigation algorithm and a robust controller to complete diverse and challenging tasks including obstacle avoidance, exploration, and enduring the wind disturbances. I made Gazebo maps for the competition and coded scoring GUI. Additionally, I coded sample controllers for the quadrotor UAV.
