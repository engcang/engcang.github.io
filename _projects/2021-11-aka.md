* *Contracted by [AKA-AI Robotics](https://akaintelligence.com/)*
* **I participated in this project during: 2021.11 - 2022.05**

　The final goal of this research project is to develop an exploration system for monitoring unknown palm tree orchard environments while avoiding collisions and figuring out appearances of trees. I developed the whole system including pointcloud data processing, path planning, and controller. A state‑of‑the‑art open‑sourced SLAM algorithm is utilized.
