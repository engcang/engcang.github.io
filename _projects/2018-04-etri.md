　Measured data from Vehicle’s multi sensor system have asynchronized sampling rate,
The final goal of this research project is to design multi-rate State  Estimator that can assume exact state using asynchronized data. Model based prediction controller is designed to perform at real-time for improving control performance. In addition, ROS based mobile robot data processing system, LiDAR data based path planning, sign recognition algorithm are researched for implementing autonomous system.
