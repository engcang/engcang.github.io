ã€€KHNP Virtual Robot Challenge aims to develop a autonomous navigation algorithm and a robust controller to complete diverse and challenging tasks including obstacle avoidance, manipulation for grasping a cube, climbing stairs, and enduring the disturbances. I made Gazebo maps for the competition and coded scoring GUI. Additionally, I coded sample controllers for the manipulator and the quadruped robot.
