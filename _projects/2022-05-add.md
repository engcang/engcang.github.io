ã€€The competition aims to develop an autonomous drone to pass through complex and dangerous outdoor obstacles, infiltrate an unknown two-story building, detect hidden targets, create precise 3D maps including target types and coordinates, and return to the starting point safely. I developed main framework including local/global path planners, 3D map logger with the detected target positions and a decision-making system.
