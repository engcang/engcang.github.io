ã€€Korea Robot Aircraft Competition aims to promote the revival of the domestic aviation industry and respond to various demands, this competition will expand the base of unmanned aviation-related technologies through participation in high school and university (graduate) students, and contribute to discovering and fostering human resources in related industries. The competition has been held every year since 2002 for the purpose of raising awareness of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and training manpower through various missions using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) developed by college students.
