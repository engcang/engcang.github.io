In 2022, the goals of the competition was to track the non-uniform motion vehicle at constant distance away with a quadrotor UAV, while avoiding obstacles. We estimated the trajectory of the moving vehicle in the form of 5th order polynomial using the detected center point with YOLO network. Then, Adaptive weight Model Predictive Controller (AMPC) is designed to track the target effectively.

  　Research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has been actively conducted in recent years. In particular, the UAV to explore an unknown, GNSS-denied environment is required, but the self-localization method, such as Visual Inertial Odometry, is mandatory to operate it. Considering the payload and the operating time of the UAV, lightweight and low-power consuming cameras and IMU are preferred, and even Object Detection and 3D Mapping can be obtained using a RGB-D camera. In this work, we developed a 3D Mapping system including object positions in an unknown and GNSS-denied environment for the UAV with a RGB-D camera. The system is demonstrated in Gazebo simulator, and the quantitative and qualitative results are obtained.</p>
